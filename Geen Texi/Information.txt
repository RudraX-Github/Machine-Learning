Project Summary:-

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and ensemble regression modeling on a taxi trip dataset (Green Taxi).
The workflow includes data cleaning, outlier removal, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and transforming features to improve model performance.
Multiple ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and Stacking) are trained to predict the total fare amount for a trip.
The best models and scaler are saved for deployment in a web application.

Problem Statement:
To accurately predict the 'Total_amount' (total fare) for a taxi trip based on features such as trip distance, passenger count, payment type, vendor, rate code, and other trip-related variables.
The goal is to build a robust regression model that can be used in a web application for fare estimation and analysis.

Suggestions:

Ensure the dataset is up-to-date and representative of real-world scenarios.
Consider feature selection and engineering for improved model interpretability.
Regularly validate model performance with new data.
Implement error handling in the web app for missing or unexpected input values.
Provide clear user instructions and visualizations in the web interface.
Web Application Description: A user-friendly web application is developed to estimate taxi fares using the trained ensemble models. Users can input trip details (distance, passenger count, payment type, etc.), and the app predicts the total fare. The app leverages the saved models and scaler for real-time predictions, providing quick and accurate fare estimates for end-users.
